Have you ever tried planning a trip and had to go to different sites to search for the flights and hotels and then add it to your calendar?

Well now you donâ€™t have to with the all in one trip planner. The trip planner combines the calendar with a flight and hotel search engine in one website. The calendar is an interactive calendar where the user can add events as they see fit, then they can add appropriate flights and hotels from the handy planner section of the website where upon entering the location it will pick out the best deals for flights and hotels.

The solution was built with django as the backend and some html css for the frontend. The interactive calendar was first created with the python module HTMLCalendar and formatted using css to display as a table form in the browser. Then the planner was added which was implemented using html and jquery and finds the best flight and hotel deals for the destination at the times specified.

Challenges faced are learning a new framework django and applying it immediately. Lessons learnt was to start early and find better teammates that contribute to the project.
